### Abstract
Similarity is fundamental to higher-order cognition, including object recognition and categorization. Cognitive theories often adopt a geometric approach, where similarity is defined by the distance between objects in a feature space, successfully explaining many human similarity relations. However, the validity of the geometric similarity model has been questioned by diverse empirical challenges, such as violations of the metric axioms (minimality, symmetry, and triangle inequality), the common features effect, contextual effects, and nearest neighbor effects. The present work reviews evidence showing that the geometric similarity model can address many of these challenges through psychologically plausible extensions of the model formalizations. Five model extensions are discussed: (i) feature-specific attention, reflecting how attention is distributed across an object's features; (ii) object-specific biases, capturing psychological properties like an object's salience or frequency in recognition tasks; (iii) category-specific parameters, such as response biases toward specific categories in categorization tasks; (iv) generalized distance functions, which include aspects beyond feature value differences, such as variability; and (v) generalized feature spaces, which represent objects in ways beyond points on a multidimensional map. Each extension addresses specific empirical challenges while maintaining cognitive plausibility. These findings suggest that the geometric model, when appropriately extended, provides a robust foundation for understanding human similarity relations and offers a path toward comprehensive theories of higher-order cognition.
